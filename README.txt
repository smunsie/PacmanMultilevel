How to play:

Pacman spawns in the normal grid. Move around the grid to collect pacdots. Pacdots are worth 10 points each. Do not hit the ghosts or you will lose a life.

To go to the frogger level you must enter the gap on the right hand side of the grid. 

Upon entering the frogger level pacman will have to pass over the road without getting hit by any vehicles.

Then pacman will need to get across the water without falling in which would result in pacman losing a life.

The door will take you back to the main grid.

To go to the platform level you must enter the gap on the left hand side.

Upon entering the platform level pacman will have to navigate through avoiding the spikes and the ghosts.

Going through the door at the end of the level will bring you back to the main grid.

To win pacman must complete the frogger level and platform level and get a score of 300 before the timer runs out.
